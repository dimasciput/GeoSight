# Context Layers
Context layers are datasets that are not bound to administrative layers and represent a variety of conditions on a global scale. Context layers are the layers that are not the direct data being analyzed, but independent variables that can be used to improve ones understanding of the given situation. These layers include a variety of environmental and humanitarian conditions such as storm forecasts, drought monitors and displacement camp sites. Similarly, these layers can include pieces of basemaps  such as roads, towns and waterways. 

## Context Layers for Administrators
Administrators are able to adjust, add and delete context layers on GeoSight. This allows them to control the availability of layers across projects and for all users.
